# ST-Mamober
A combined architecture of STG-Mamba and T-Graphormer

STG Mamba part is still under work. We have tried just plugging the classes of both models but got really bad results. So now we are making our own modules both for STG-Mamba and T-Graphromer individually and both of them will be merged in future.

The work we have done and the result we have got is shared as a colab ipynb file.

There is nothing more to add to the kalman filter.

Modules and updates on Graphormer block will be pushed in the Transformer directory

_as of 5/07/2025_
